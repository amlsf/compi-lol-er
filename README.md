============

Writing a compiler for my made up language (EmC[], E=mc^2, Em's Compiler, emcetera emcetera)  and experimenting with different methods

File Tree (In Progress):
  - PLY_Lexer_Parser: This is one version of the lexer and parser that were fairly simple and not at all robust. As a result, I dropped this approach in order to use Pratt's methods which were far more creative and intriguing.
    -->
  - Pratt: THE OFFICIAL LEXER AND PARSER that are used with my compiler. His methods are explained fairly 
    -->
  - Udacity_Prog_Lang: Took the "Programming Languages" course (#262) on udacity.com, these python exercises were the most difficult and interesting to me both code-wise and theoretically
    --> 
  - lisp_interpreter: Went through and coded Norvig's Lispy interpreter from http://norvig.com/lispy.html and because it was fairly straightforward, most of my personal involvement was in commenting to make sure that I fully understood all that was taking place
